      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <p>
        Hey there, fellow food enthusiasts! We get it; cooking can sometimes
        feel like a rollercoaster of surprises. So, here&#39;s a laid-back FAQ
        to address some of your questions and maybe add a little sprinkle of joy
        to your culinary journey.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Can I Get Creative and Swap Ingredients in Your Recipes?</h2>
      <p>
        Absolutely! We totally understand if you&#39;re missing that one random
        ingredient or have some dietary restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here&#39;s the deal: our recipes are tried and true with the
        specified ingredients. Switching things up might lead to a different
        flavor or texture, and we can&#39;t predict exactly how it&#39;ll turn
        out without further testing. So, consider it a mini adventure in your
        kitchen.

        2. Help! I Tried One of Your Recipes, and It Went South. What&#39;s Up?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Hey, it happens to the best of us, right? We share recipes that have
        been rockstars in our kitchen, but we can&#39;t peek into yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don&#39;t forget: Loads of factors can affect the outcome, like the
        quality of your ingredients, your cooking skills, and even the mood of
        your kitchen appliances.

        3. What&#39;s the Secret to Storing Leftovers? How Long Do They Last?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here&#39;s the scoop: we&#39;re not food safety experts, but we have
        some good ol&#39; common-sense advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Storing leftovers depends on the dish and your storage skills - trust
        us. If it smells okay and looks fine, it&#39;s probably still good. But
        trust your gut (literally) and use your judgment.
      </p>
      <h2>4. Can I Pop That Dish in the Freezer?</h2>
      <p>
        Sure, you can freeze it if you&#39;re feeling like you would want it
        later!
      </p>

      <p>
        We&#39;ve got freezing tips for some dishes, but not for all. If
        you&#39;re observing a recipe without freezing instructions, go ahead
        and take the plunge.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, cooking is all about exploring, and who knows, you might
        uncover a hidden culinary gem!
